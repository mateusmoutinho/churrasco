# `help-flag`

Answer `<command> --help` with that command's help

A middleware: it runs on rung 5, in front of every command line matching
`*`, and hands the line on unless it answers.

Runs in front of every command line. Without --help it hands the line on. With it, it prints the help of the next strict command the line is for — or the general help when there is none — unless that command declares a --help flag of its own, which then reads it.
