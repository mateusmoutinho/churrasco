# Commands

`churrasco <command> [args] [flags]`. `churrasco help <command>`, or `churrasco <command> --help`,
prints the same for one command; an empty command line prints the general help and exits 0.
A command declaring a `--help` flag of its own keeps it, and is described through `help` alone.

One page per command, each rendered from that command's `command.yaml`
([CommandYaml](../CommandYaml/doc.md)) on each build — open the one you need rather than this
whole page. Hidden commands are not listed. The args are the leading words of the command line;
the flags follow them, in any order. A `repeatable` flag is given once per value. A command's page
lists the flags of the middlewares in front of it too.
