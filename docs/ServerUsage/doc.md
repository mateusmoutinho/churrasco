# ServerUsage

The server layer mirrors the cli layer file for file: `sandbox/internal/routeslist/<name>/` is to
a route what `sandbox/internal/commands/<name>/` is to a command, and `route.yaml` is to it what
`command.yaml` is to a command.

## Bring it up

```bash
agnos server-init  # serverdeps, signaldeps, the server layer, the health route, start-server
churrasco start-server  # listens on the first free port of 3000..4000; Ctrl+C shuts it down gracefully
churrasco start-server --addr 4000:5000 --read-timeout-ms 30000 --shutdown-timeout-ms 5000
curl localhost:3000/health
```

`--addr` is a port (`8080`), a range the server takes the first free port of (`4000:5000`), either
one behind a host (`127.0.0.1:4000:5000`), or a plain `host:port` (`:8080`). The address it landed
on is printed to stdout — `server listening on :3001` — so a test running several servers reads it
from there. A project whose `start-server` predates the range keeps its old `:8080` default, since
its `command.yaml` is the project's: `agnos remove-flag addr --command start-server`, then
`add-flag` it again with `--default 3000:4000`.

`server-init` installs the CLI layer first when the project has none — a server needs a command
that starts it. `server-purge` removes the server layer again and leaves the CLI in place.

A Go caller skips the command entirely:

```go
sandbox := sandbox.New(&deps)
err := sandbox.Server.Serve(api.ServeProps{Addr: "3000:4000", ReadTimeoutMs: 10000, WriteTimeoutMs: 10000, ShutdownTimeoutMs: 10000})
```

`Serve` blocks until the server stops. The first interrupt or termination request stops it
gracefully: no new request is taken, and the ones in flight get `ShutdownTimeoutMs` (`0` waits
for them).

## Declare a route

```bash
agnos add-route create-user --pattern '/users/{tenant}' --method POST --help "Create a user" --category Users
agnos add-route get-article --pattern '/articles/{article:integer}'
agnos add-route admin --trigger /admin --trigger-type prefix        # /admin, /admin/…, never /administrator
agnos add-route admin-guard --middleware --trigger /admin --before admin
agnos add-parameter authorization --route create-user --font header --required
agnos add-parameter page --route create-user --type integer --default 1
agnos set-body create-user --type json --required
agnos add-body-field email --route create-user --format email --required
agnos set-parameter page --route create-user --font query --font header
agnos show-route create-user
agnos list-routes                                      # the chain, in run order
agnos explain-route GET /admin/users --header authorization=abc
agnos rename-route create-user register-user
agnos rebalance-routes --step 10
agnos remove-parameter page --route create-user
agnos remove-route register-user
```

`add-route` writes `route.yaml` (the declaration — `priority` and `response-type` always
included, and either the paths `--pattern` compiles to or one path, `Route`, reading the whole
request path against `--trigger`) and a stub `InternalPureHandler.go` (yours); `build` generates `new.go`, the `api.Route` that lands in
`Server.Routes`, and `entries.go`, the `Entries` the handler is handed. One editor per place the
declaration holds something — `add-path`, `add-parameter`, `set-body`, `add-body-field`,
`set-route`, each with its `remove-` inverse — so every key of [RouteYaml](../RouteYaml/doc.md)
is reachable from the command line and `route.yaml` is never edited by hand.

Each `add-` has a `set-` beside it — `set-path`, `set-parameter`, `set-body-field` — which edits
the declaration that is there instead of replacing it: the keys given are written over the ones
already declared, `--clear <key>` takes one off, `--rename` changes the name it answers to, and
the result goes through the same constructor the `add-` side calls.

`add-path` reads a slice of the request path, `--start` to `--end` (`-1` the last segment), into
`Entries.<Id>`, converted to its `--type` (`string`, `integer`, `number`, `uuid`); with
`--trigger` (and `--trigger-type equal|prefix|text-prefix|suffix|regex|one-of`, `--trigger-negate`,
`--trigger-ignore-case`) the route only runs when the slice matches. `add-parameter` reads one value from the `--font`s given, in order;
its `--trigger` is a condition on the **value**, and the route runs only when it holds
([RouteYaml](../RouteYaml/doc.md#parameter-keys)).
`add-body-field` takes a dotted path (`address.city`), creating the intervening objects in the
`json-schema`. `import-body` declares a whole payload at once from an example of it:

```bash
agnos import-body create-user --file payload.json --required --infer-format
agnos import-body create-user --json '{"email":"a@b.co","age":30,"tags":["x"]}'
```

It infers a type per key, the objects and lists around them, `--required` for every key the
example carries, and — with `--infer-format` — the `email`, `uuid`, `date-time` and `uri` a
string spells. A property already declared is never written over; `--replace` starts the schema
over instead. What it infers is a starting point, and every bound after that is
`set-body-field`'s.

`show-route <route>` prints the declaration as a tree — the request line, its place in the
chain, the paths, the parameters and the body schema property by property. `list-routes` prints
the whole chain in run order, and `explain-route` runs one request against it, saying for each
route whether it runs or why it is skipped. The three write nothing and run no build.

## Write the handler

```go
func InternalPureHandler(sandbox *api.Sandbox, props *routeprops.RouteProps, entries *Entries, response *serverdeps.Response) error {
	if props.User == "" { // set by a middleware in front
		return routeio.Fail(sandbox, api.StatusUnauthorized, "authorization", "not authorized")
	}
	response.SetStatus(api.StatusCreated)
	response.Write(payload(sandbox, createUser(sandbox, entries.Tenant, entries.Body)))
	return nil
}
```

`entries` arrives bound and converted — the body too, on `entries.Body` — and the response
already carries the route's `response-type`; a bad request was already answered `400` before
the handler ran. Every value is
a field of `Entries`, named by its id ([RouteYaml](../RouteYaml/doc.md#entries-and-internalpurehandler)).

**Setting a status or writing a byte is what answers the request.** A handler that does neither
has declined, and the next route matching this request runs — that is the whole of what a
middleware is; what it learned travels to the routes after it on `props`, the request's
`routeprops.RouteProps`, whose fields the project declares in `sandbox/internal/routeprops/project.go`. Returning
`routeio.Fail` refuses the request through the `Handle*` file of its status; any other error
means "I could not answer this", and hands it to `handle_server_error.go`; returning `nil` means "done" or "not mine", which the
answer tells apart.
[Routes](../Routes/doc.md) documents the route on the next build, and
[RouteYaml](../RouteYaml/doc.md#the-chain) has the chain in full.

## Answer the failures

`build` writes eight more files into `sandbox/internal/server/errors/`, one per way a request can
end without a route answering it — `handle_not_found.go`, `handle_method_not_allowed.go`,
`handle_bad_request.go`, `handle_unauthorized.go`, `handle_forbidden.go`, `handle_too_large.go`,
`handle_wrong_content_type.go` and `handle_server_error.go`. Each is yours: written
once, never regenerated. Editing what your server says when nothing matches is editing
`handle_not_found.go` and nothing else. The table and the shape are in
[RouteYaml](../RouteYaml/doc.md#failures).

A Go caller reads the same surface without a socket: `Server.Routes` is every declared route,
in run order, and `api.BindRoute` copies one into the route a single request runs on.
