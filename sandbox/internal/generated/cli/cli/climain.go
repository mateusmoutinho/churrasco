// CliMain is the whole dispatch layer: it runs every command of Cli.Commands
// the command line is for, in the order the collector put them — lowest
// `priority` first — and returns the exit status the line was answered with.
// Whether a command is for the line is its own IsActionable's to say; binding
// and running it is its own CommandHandler's.
//
// More than one command may be for one line, which is what a chain is: each one
// runs in turn until one of them **answers** — sets a status, or prints to
// stdout, which answers ExitOk. A middleware that does neither has declined, so
// the next command runs — that is the whole of what makes a middleware a
// middleware; a strict command that does neither ran silently, and answers
// ExitOk. A handler that returns an error ends the chain too, answered or
// not, through HandleFailure. Every command of one line is handed one
// CommandProps and one Consumed, which is how a middleware hands what it
// learned, and the tokens it read, to the commands after it.
//
// Nothing here prints itself. Every way a line can end without a command
// answering it — nothing matched, a value that will not bind, a token nobody
// read, a panic — is raised through cliio.Raise and answered by one of the
// project's own Handle* files.
// Nothing here is generated per command: every command is one declaration
// built by its own NewCommand and collected by
// sandbox/internal/generated/cli/cli/new.go, so this file is the same in every
// project.
