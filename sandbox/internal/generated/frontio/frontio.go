package frontio

// The project's file layer for the front: it maps a request path onto one file
// of the embedded assets/frontend/ tree and names the media type that file is
// served as. It holds no opinion about what that tree is — hand-written html,
// or the dist/ of any bundler — so whatever lands in assets/frontend/ is
// served as it is.
//
// It is a leaf of sandbox/internal/: it imports the contracts and nothing
// else under internal/, so the frontend route and anything else in the
// sandbox may reach for it. It is also what tells `build` this project carries
// the front layer, the way sandbox/internal/server tells it about the server
// one. The route that serves the tree is the project's; this package, and the
// path check in it, is rewritten by every build.
