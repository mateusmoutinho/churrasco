// Tracked wraps one response so the dispatch can tell whether a handler
// answered the request. It returns the wrapper to hand to the handlers and a
// reader of the status the request was answered with, 0 while none was.
//
// Answering is what ends a chain, and there are two ways to answer: setting a
// status, or writing a byte — the http library sends a 200 ahead of the first
// byte of a body, so a Write before any SetStatus is that 200, said out loud.
// SetHeader alone answers nothing, which is how a middleware adds a header to
// whatever answers after it. That rule lives here rather than in serverdeps
// because a dep states what a library can do and never what this project does
// with it — the contract is a struct of function fields precisely so the
// sandbox can wrap it like this.
