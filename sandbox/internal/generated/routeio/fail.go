// handed no route to raise it on, so it is RequestHandler — which holds the
// bound route — that raises what comes back through Raise, reaching the
// project's own Handle* file for that status:
//
//	return routeio.Fail(sandbox, api.StatusUnauthorized, "authorization", "invalid token")

// Raise is the one way the server layer itself raises a failure on a bound

// status — HandleBadRequest, HandleTooLarge, HandleWrongContentType,
// HandleServerError — through sandbox.Server.Fail.
//
// It goes through the api rather than calling sandbox/internal/server/errors
// because the package that routes to it, sandbox/internal/generated/server/server,
// imports every route package, so no route may import it back. The field on
// the api is what crosses that line, and it is filled by the generated
// sandbox/internal/generated/server/server/new.go.

// FailureOf is the failure one of the project's Handle* files is answering. A

// body the schema rejected — answers with that, because it says something no
// file could say in advance, and one that carries none answers with the file's.
//
// That is the split that makes a Handle* file worth editing. The dispatch
// raises "nothing matched" and "method not allowed" with no message at all, so
// the wording comes from handle_not_found.go and handle_method_not_allowed.go
// and changing it there changes what the server says. It also keeps every
// handler free of a nil check.
