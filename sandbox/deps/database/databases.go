package database

// This file is the whole of Keep's database surface: the Databases contract
// that reaches the Sandbox as the field of the same name, and the types that
// cross it in either direction.
//
// Every type here is a struct — never an interface. A type that carries
// behaviour holds it as function fields, filled by sandbox/internal/databases
// at the moment the object is built; a type that carries none (Item, Schema,
// Props, Error) is plain data a caller writes as a composite literal. None of
// them names the dependencies the library was wired with: a record reaches
// storage through the closure it was built with, not through a field a caller
// could read or replace.

// Field types, reported by Item.Type.

	// Key is a unique, indexed string field. Two live records of one
	// collection can never hold the same value for it, and it is the only
	// kind of field SchemaInstance.FindByKey looks a record up by.

	// Int is a plain integer field, stored in its decimal form and handed
	// back as an int64.
	Int
	// Database is a nested collection of records, reached through
	// SchemaItem.NewSubItem and SchemaItem.ListAll rather than read as a
	// value.
	Database
	// Float is a plain floating-point field, stored in the shortest decimal
	// form that parses back to the same number and handed back as a
	// float64.
	Float
	// String is a plain text field. It is written like a Key and read back
	// as a string, but it carries no index: two live records of one
	// collection may hold the same value for it, and SchemaInstance.FindByKey
	// never looks a record up by one.
	String
	// Link is a reference to a record of another collection, named by the
	// field's Target. It is stored as that record's id and read back as an
	// int64, and SchemaItem.GetLink resolves it to the record itself. Like
	// any id it is never reused, so a link to a removed record resolves to
	// nothing rather than to whatever took its place.
