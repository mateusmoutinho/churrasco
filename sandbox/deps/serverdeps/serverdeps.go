package serverdeps

// This package is the sandbox's *copy* of the api an http-server library
// exposes — the same mechanic as argvdeps, iodeps, rundeps and std, for the
// same reason: opening a socket is an OS-bound effect, so `net/http` may not
// appear inside the sandbox. The contract is restated here, and the adapter —
// which lives outside the sandbox — is what fills it.
//
// The contract is deliberately unopinionated: it opens the port, applies the
// timeouts and hands every request to the one Handler. Routing, method
// dispatch, path parameters, 404 and 405 are the generated
// sandbox/internal/generated/server/server/servermain.go's business, never the library's.
// Only builtin types cross this boundary — no `time.Time`, no `io.Reader`, no
// type of the concrete library.

// Sandbox is the http-server library injected whole as the Deps.Serverdeps field.
// A server is bound to one address and one handler, so it is created per call
// rather than injected once: what the sandbox holds is this one-field struct.
type Sandbox struct {
	// NewServer builds a server over the given props. It binds nothing until
	// Server.Bind or Server.Listen is called.
	NewServer func(props ServerProps) Server
}

// ServerProps is everything one server needs to run: where to listen, how
// long a request and a response may take, and the single function every
// request is handed to.
type ServerProps struct {
	// Addr is the address to listen on, in the host:port spelling
	// (":8080", "127.0.0.1:3000").
	Addr string
	// ReadTimeoutMs is how long a request has to arrive, in milliseconds.
	// Zero means no timeout.
	ReadTimeoutMs int
	// WriteTimeoutMs is how long a response has to be written, in
	// milliseconds. Zero means no timeout.
	WriteTimeoutMs int
	// ShutdownTimeoutMs is how long Shutdown waits for the requests in
	// flight, in milliseconds, before it closes them. Zero means it waits
	// for every one.
	ShutdownTimeoutMs int
	// Handler is called once per request, whatever the method or the path.
	// Everything the request needs to be answered is reachable from the two
	// arguments; the handler returns once the response is written.
	Handler func(request Request, response Response)
}

// Server is one built-but-not-yet-listening http server.
type Server struct {
	// Bind opens the address without serving it yet, and reports why it
	// could not — the address is taken, the host is unknown. It does not
	// block. Calling it is optional: Listen binds first when it was not.
	Bind func() error
	// Listen serves the address Bind opened — binding it first when Bind
	// was not called — until Shutdown is called or the server fails. It
	// blocks.
	Listen func() error
	// Shutdown stops the server, letting the requests in flight finish.
	Shutdown func() error

// Request is one incoming http request, read through function fields only:

	// GetClientIp returns the ip of the connection the request came on,

	// for it: whether a proxy in front is trusted is the sandbox's to say.
	GetClientIp func() string
	// GetCookie returns the value of the named cookie, or "" when the
	// request carries none by that name.

	// GetQueryParam returns the first value of the named query parameter,

	// order they appear, for a field declared `array: true`.

	// ReadBody reads at most limit bytes of the request body (-1 reads it
	// whole) and reports an error when the body is longer than limit or
	// cannot be read. The body is read once: a second call returns what the
	// first one read.
	ReadBody func(limit int) ([]byte, error)
